# DNF Plugin Azure Auth Configuration
# 
# This file configures which repositories should use Azure AD authentication.
# Add a section for each repository ID that should use Azure AD tokens.
#
# Format:
#   [repo-id]
#   # No additional options currently - just listing the repo enables Azure AD auth
#
# Example:
#   [azure-rpm-repo]
#
# The repo-id must match the repository ID in /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo files.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. az cli must be installed and logged in (az login)
#   2. User must have "Storage Blob Data Reader" role on the storage account
#   3. Storage account must have Azure AD authentication enabled
#
# For Azure VMs with Managed Identity:
#   az login --identity
#
# For pre-generated tokens (CI/CD or bootstrapping):
#   export DNF_PLUGIN_AZURE_AUTH_TOKEN="<token>"
